## Biography

Linus Torvalds created Linux in 1991 while a student at the University of Helsinki. He continues to lead Linux kernel development, making final decisions on what code gets merged into the kernel. He also created Git in 2005.

## Daily Work

- Reviewing and merging patches from subsystem maintainers
- Managing merge windows and release cycles
- Guiding architectural decisions for the kernel
- Coordinating with hardware vendors and distributions

## Challenges

> "I'm not a visionary. I'm an engineer. I'm perfectly happy with all the people who are walking around and thinking about clouds and the future."

## Impact

Linux powers virtually all of the world's supercomputers, most servers on the internet, Android smartphones, and countless embedded devices. Linus's decisions shape the foundation of modern computing infrastructure.
