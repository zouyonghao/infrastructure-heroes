### Overview

BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small executable. It provides replacements for most of the utilities you usually find in GNU fileutils, shellutils, etc.

### Importance

- Found in nearly every embedded Linux device
- Used in routers, IoT devices, containers
- Essential for initramfs and rescue systems
- Millions of devices depend on it

### ⚠️ Critical Alert

BusyBox is severely under-maintained. The project has very few active contributors and minimal funding, despite being critical infrastructure for millions of devices.

### How to Help

- Code review and bug fixes
- Security audit support
- Funding through direct sponsorship
- Documentation improvements
