### Overview

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

### Importance

- Used by virtually every software development team
- Powers GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and most code hosting
- Foundation of modern DevOps and CI/CD workflows
- Essential for open source collaboration

### Key Features

- Distributed development
- Strong support for non-linear development
- Efficient handling of large projects
- Cryptographic authentication of history

### Sustainability

Git is maintained by Junio Hamano and a community of contributors. While widely used, direct funding is limited compared to its impact. Development is supported partly by companies like Google.
