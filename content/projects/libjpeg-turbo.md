### Overview

libjpeg-turbo is a JPEG image codec that uses SIMD instructions to accelerate baseline JPEG compression and decompression.

### Importance

- Most widely used JPEG library
- Powers image handling everywhere
- Critical for web performance
- Used by browsers and applications

### Key Features

- SIMD acceleration
- JPEG encoding/decoding
- Progressive JPEG support
- Lossless transformations

### Sustainability

libjpeg-turbo is maintained by a single developer with minimal funding. This critical library needs sustainable support.
