### Overview

The Linux kernel is a free and open-source, monolithic, modular, multitasking, Unix-like operating system kernel. It is the foundation of the Linux family of operating systems (commonly called Linux distributions or distros).

### Importance

- Powers 96.3% of the world's top one million servers
- Runs on all of the world's top 500 supercomputers
- Android is based on the Linux kernel (3.9 billion active devices)
- Foundation of cloud infrastructure (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)

### Key Features

- Process and memory management
- Device drivers and hardware abstraction
- Network stack and protocols
- Security modules (SELinux, AppArmor)
- Container support (cgroups, namespaces)

### Governance

Linus Torvalds remains the ultimate authority for kernel releases, but the project has a well-established lieutenant system that distributes knowledge across multiple subsystem maintainers.
