- Used by Apple, Google, Sony, and major tech companies
- Foundation for language development
- Critical for mobile and systems programming

### Key Features

- Modular compiler design
- Strong optimization passes
- Cross-platform code generation
- JIT compilation support

### Sustainability

LLVM is well-funded through the LLVM Foundation and corporate sponsors. It has a healthy contributor base and active development community.
