### Overview

OpenSSH is a suite of secure networking utilities based on the Secure Shell protocol, providing encrypted communications over an unsecured network.

### Importance

- Secures remote access to virtually all Unix/Linux servers
- Default SSH implementation for most operating systems
- Foundation of secure infrastructure management
- Used by millions of servers and developers daily

### Key Features

- Strong encryption and authentication
- Port forwarding and tunneling
- Key-based authentication
- SFTP and SCP support

### Sustainability

OpenSSH is developed primarily by the OpenBSD project. While critical to internet security, it relies heavily on OpenBSD Foundation funding and volunteer contributions.
