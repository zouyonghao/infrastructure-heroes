### Importance

- Powers HTTPS for millions of websites
- Essential for secure communications
- Used by countless applications and operating systems
- Critical for global internet security

### Key Features

- SSL/TLS protocol implementation
- Cryptographic algorithms
- Certificate management
- FIPS 140-2 validation support

### Security History

Following the Heartbleed vulnerability in 2014, the project received more attention and funding, but long-term sustainability remains a concern.
