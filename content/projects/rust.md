### Importance

- Growing adoption for systems programming
- Foundation for memory-safe infrastructure
- Used by Linux kernel, Firefox, and more
- Critical for security-sensitive applications

### Key Features

- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Fearless concurrency
- Zero-cost abstractions
- Rich type system

### Sustainability

Rust is supported by the Rust Foundation with strong corporate backing from AWS, Google, Microsoft, Mozilla, and Huawei.
