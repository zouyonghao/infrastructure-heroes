### Overview

SQLite is a C library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine. It is the most used database engine in the world.

### Importance

- Embedded in every smartphone (iOS and Android)
- Used by Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and most browsers
- Included in Python, PHP, and many programming languages
- Found in billions of devices worldwide

### Key Features

- Zero-configuration database
- Serverless architecture
- Single file storage
- ACID compliant
- Cross-platform

### Sustainability

SQLite is developed by a small team led by D. Richard Hipp through Hwaci. While well-funded through consulting and support contracts, the project relies heavily on a small team.
