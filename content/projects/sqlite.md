- Included in Python, PHP, and many programming languages
- Found in billions of devices worldwide

### Key Features

- Zero-configuration database
- Serverless architecture
- Single file storage
- ACID compliant

### Sustainability

SQLite is developed by a small team led by D. Richard Hipp through Hwaci. While well-funded through consulting and support contracts, the project relies heavily on a small team.
