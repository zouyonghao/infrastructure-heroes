- Innovative compilation approach
- Foundation for lightweight apps
- Influencing the ecosystem

### Key Features

- Compile-time framework
- No virtual DOM
- Reactive declarations
- Built-in animations

### Sustainability

Svelte is maintained by Rich Harris (now at Vercel) with community support but limited direct funding.
