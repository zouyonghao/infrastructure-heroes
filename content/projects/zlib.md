- Embedded in Python, Java, .NET, and most programming languages
- Critical dependency for package managers and web servers
- Foundation of modern data compression on the internet

### Key Features

- Fast compression and decompression
- Portable C implementation
- In-memory compression
- gzip file format support

### Sustainability

zlib has been maintained by Mark Adler and Jean-loup Gailly since 1995. The project has minimal funding and relies on volunteer effort for a library used by billions of devices.
